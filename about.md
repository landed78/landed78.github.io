Hands-on, self-starter, going above and beyond.

### About Me


Growing up, I have always been curious about alot of things and building things from scratch (aka reverse engineering). I grew up in the 90s learning to program in Visual basic, self-taught web development and photoshop and was great at drawing and electronics.

I studied computer science and information systems at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia) where I learnt natural language technology (comp240/248) the foundations of machine learning/artificial intelligence. I later pursued a Masters of Arts at UTS focusing on communication and organisational science - this is where I developed a deep passion for combining the arts and the sciences (technology).

I have worked for many different organisations across many different industries and met colleagues from all parts of the world. I started in IBM consulting, PwC/Strategy& and spent the past decade as an independant analyst/consultant (no non-sense analyst and project delivery). I have a proven track record from many organisations such as IBM, Woolworths, Telstra, CentralNIC, NAB/MLC, Westpac, CBRE, Cochlear and Suncorp).

Lastly, I enjoy connecting and helping people succeed in life - whether it's volunteering or helping someone fix their bike.
